    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A calzone is an Italian dish that features a circular piece of pizza or
      yeasted bread dough that's folded in half over a filling that includes
      ricotta, and often mozzarella and Parmesan, too, cured meats, vegetables
      and herbs, then sealed shut using a crimping technique
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dry milk powder</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
      <li>¾ cup pizza sauce</li>
      <li>4 ounces pepperoni sausage, chopped</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place water, salt, bread flour, dry milk, sugar, and yeast in the pan of
        the bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Select
        Dough cycle.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the cycle has finished, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175
        degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface; shape it into a 16x10-inch
        rectangle. Transfer to prepared baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, mix together chopped pepperoni and mozzarella. Spoon
        pizza sauce in a stripe down the center of dough lengthwise; add
        pepperoni and cheese filling. Make diagonal cuts 1 1/2 inches apart down
        each side, cutting within a 1/2 inch of the filling. Criss-cross strips
        over filling, sealing with water. Brush top with melted butter.
      </li>
      <li>Bake calzone in preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
